# DoEntertainUs
easily searchable activity database for a geographical area

Will be a resource to find things to do. 
Most of the issue with the statement ‘there’s nothing fun to do in my city’ is that most of the ‘things to do’ are unknown to the person saying that statement. These events/entertainment locations/’things to do’ need to be a resource that is easily available to people.
 	
Thus a website should be created with this information, easily manageable by location, target audience (age, gender, relationship status) and type (indoor,outdoor,bars,single events/regularly open(bowling/paintball/library) /parks etc)

Each location will have it’s own page detailing the facilities / activities that it offers. As you can imagine there will be 100+ different types of facilities in total and even a certain type of location can’t have a template set of facilities to show - some bars have bowling alleys, or arcades. Different entertainment establishments will have several different facilities and it would be too cumbersome to categorize each as ‘bowling alley, paintball, amusement park, etc’ - they should all be in one category to make it easier for the user. 
---To resolve this, rather than showing a template of what the establishment has/doesn’t have -  Only list the facilities that the establishment offers. Omit what they don’t offer.

Establishments may attempt to take advantage of the service and provide false information online - say they have facilities they don’t actually have, provide incorrect/misleading pricing.
---To resolve this provide an easy to use feedback/report feature for the user to report discrepancies. If an establishment is found to providing incorrect information it will be requested to update the information. If not done within an amount of time (suggest 48 hours) then the establishment’s listing will be suspended until it is updated, repeat offenders will be suspended a week, or more minimum depending on how many times and severity of offence. (whether it’s outright false information, misleading, or just outdated)

Establishment pages can be created ad-hoc but can be claimed by their owner by phone verification. (manual)
